Our friend [Miguel Landaeta][1] has built a new unofficial Debian package for beta 2 of Turpial 3 and fixing the dependencies issue. You can download it from our files repo:  And you can check package integrity with the .sha1sum file. This package was built in Debian unstable but should be usable in testing as well (if not, please let us know) For current Debian stable, Miguel will build backports when packages get accepted on official repos. This packages probably could be rebuilt without any issue in Ubuntu too. For libturpial, the package is the same 1.0 version. Feel free to test them and send us any feedback.
