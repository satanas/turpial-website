Thanks to our friend [Miguel Landaeta][1] we have unofficial Debian packages for Turpial 3.0-b1 and for libturpial 1.0. You can download them from our files repo:  There, you will find .sha1sum files to verify packages integrity. This packages were built in Debian unstable but should be usable in testing as well (if not, please let us know) For current Debian stable, Miguel will build backports when packages get accepted on official repos again. This packages probably could be rebuilt without any issue in Ubuntu too. Feel free to test them and send us any feedback.
