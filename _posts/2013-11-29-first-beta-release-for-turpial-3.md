 Some days ago I announced the [ETAs for the final version of the application][1], and after a [couple of days of delay][2] we are ready to announce with tears in the eyes what means one of the biggest milestones for the project since the last two years: **the first beta release of a new Turpial version**. This beta implies that, from this moment, I won't be working to include new features but focused on testing and fixing mayor or blocking bugs reported during tests. I encourage you to test this beta release and report any issue on my [github repository][3] or in our [mailing list][4]. I have a list with all the stuff that will be developed for future versions that will be published during the final release, so please **DO NOT** request any new feature until you read that list. You can get this beta release following the steps on the [wiki page for the installation of the development version][5] or via [PyPI][6] using: 

    pip install turpial Remember in any case check the 

[list of dependencies on the wiki][7]. The source code is available from our [files repository][8] as usual. Thanks everyone for your patience and your support, hope you love it! **Update:** The testing phase should be of two weeks, so if everything is fine the final release will be at December 15th. **Update 2:** If you want test Turpial in another language or if Turpial is not loading the language of your system try executing in a shell: 

    LANG=X && turpial Where X is the code for the desired language. For example: es, eo, ru_RU.
