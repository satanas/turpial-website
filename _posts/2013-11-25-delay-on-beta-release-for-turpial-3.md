[][1] Almost 20 days ago [I announced the estimated time of arrival of Turpial 3][2] and yesterday was the day planned for the first beta release. Although the feature list is ready there are a couple of details that I need to solve to don't affect the user experience. I'll be working hard on these stuffs this days to release the first beta as soon as possible (no more than 2 days). Meanwhile, there are lot of people helping with the [translations of Turpial][3]. Currently we have support for Spanish and English, while French, German and Portuguese (Brazil) are under revision. If you want to contribute with the project, translation is a good change. You can contribute too helping us to spread the word. Thank you all for your patience and support.
