I've the pleasure to announce the official ETA of Turpial 3 for November 30th, 2013. Code freeze will be on November 24th with a beta release and from this point there will be one week for testing until November 30th. If everything is OK the final release will be that day. You maybe are wondering "Turpial 3? What the f... happened with Turpial 2?". Well, Turpial has grown too much, has had lots of failures, versions that didn't see the light and that's the way I wanted to let you know. The distance between versions gives you an idea of how much things have happened since Turpial 1.6 and set your expectations to a fresh and renewed application. I hope you like what is coming.
