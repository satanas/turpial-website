The past weeks I have been working on new improvements for [libturpial][1] and one of the most important things that I accomplished is the isolation of modules. Well, that and the definitive fix for the memory leaks issue.

The [http][2] module was migrated from [urllib][3] to [Requests][4], this solved the memory leaks issue and let me build a new structure for this module, now it only cares for GET and POST requests (as should be) and can be tested separately, outside a libturpial environment. After came the adaptation of [protocol][5] module, this means integration with the new http module and update the API version (v1.1) for the [Twitter implementation][6]. Finally, yesterday I was working with the [account][7] module, this integrates all the configuration part and now we can easily load the existing profiles of libturpial into a shell and make tweets, fetch the timeline, see our mentions and further.

Modules that need to be improved yet are the [account manager][8] and the final integration into the [core][9]. With this I could make some unit test and start an official testing phase for a next stable release.

That's all for now. EOF
