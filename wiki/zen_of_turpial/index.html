<h1>Zen of Turpial</h1>

<p>These are the guidelines that define Turpial and make it such a great application. It's the place where we need to 
search when times of hard decisions come. Six aphorisms that define us as project, that is the Zen of Turpial.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Light is better than overcharged.</li>
  <li>Ugly is better than slow.</li>
  <li>Native is better than universal.</li>
  <li>User comfort counts.</li>
  <li>Usability counts.</li>
  <li>RAM matters.</li>
  <li>Turpial always will be Free Software.</li>
</ul>

<p>And remembering Python's Zen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
  <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
  <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
  <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
  <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
  <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
  <li>Readability counts.</li>
  <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
  <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
  <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
  <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
  <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
  <li>There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.</li>
  <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
  <li>Now is better than never.</li>
  <li>Although never is often better than right now.</li>
  <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
  <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
  <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!</li>
</ul>
