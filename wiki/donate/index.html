<h1>Donate</h1>

<p>So, you like Turpial and are willing to help but cannot code? Well you can buy us a coffee to keep us awake 
working hard on Turpial.</p>

<p>Seriously, donating is a really good way to help the project grow and keep us motivated to continue innovating and 
making such a great application. Obviously, none of your hard-earned money will be invested on paying tropical 
holidays, gadgets, lots of wine or fancy cars for Turpial developers.</p>

<p>You can donate via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012044900/https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=3QDYV3JLXPQ7U" title="Paypal">Paypal</a> 
or via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012044900/http://flattr.com/thing/452623/Turpial" title="Flattr">Flattr</a>. 
Come on, don't be shy.</p>
